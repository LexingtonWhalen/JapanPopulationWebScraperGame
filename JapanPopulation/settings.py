###DISCLAIMER: This is by no means a political statement.
###I just wanted to learn a bit of pygame and I was interested in webscraping.
###So this is the result. I am NOT saying that Shinzo Abe should be held in a negative light.
###I include videos of him as I recently saw a video where he tries many fruits, and I thought it was funny
###He says "juicy" quite often.
